## Welcome

Hi, I'm Brent.  I'm a senior data engineer researching innovation in web search
at the [Center of Complex Interventions](https://www.centerofci.org).  Before
that, I was the senior data engineer at
[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org).  I'm the former maintainer of
the [CC Catalog](https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog) project, and
continue to maintain relationships with alumni of that project.

When I'm not Engineering Data, I enjoy walking my dog in the forest.
